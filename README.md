## Design

### Images
The two images used in this website contain both a background image which is an old map-like render and a black and white image of the musician Conor Connolly playing an accordion at a concert. The old map-like image invites the user into a space where something rich and traditional is being conveyed since the content is that of an Irish traditional musician and the black and white photo of Conor further eccentuates this concept.

### Colors
The colors chosen on this website are a rich array of browns, black, greys and whites. These were chosen to compliment the background image and the main hero image. Alongside the images the font colors compliment the mood and emotional response of the user allowing the user to focus on the validity of the content.

### Fonts
There is one primary font used throughout the website which is Vollkorn complimented with a serif. The absense of multiple fonts creates continuity and a seamless view to the whole site. The Vollkorn font is that of an old style  which is appropriate to the overall theme. The font sizing ranges from 4.375rem to 0.938rem across the website. The font coloring is such so that it stands out sufficiently for to make overall accessibility successful.
