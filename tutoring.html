        <p>
            Conor provides a range of tutoring services on both button accordion and piano accompaniment. These range
            from private in-person one-to-one and group teaching as well as online tailored classes on Zoom. Conor has also 
            been invited to and also currently teaches master workshops at some of the most prestigious summer schools on the calendar
            including Scoil Samhradh Willie Clancy in Miltown Malbay and Feakle International Music Festival.
        </p>

        <p>
            While teaching music can be seen as just teaching written out notes on a page or from a website, Conor 
            prides himself in having a great love for the wonderful history behind our ancient music which
            he incorporates into his tutoring. Immersing a student into the music in this way emboldens them to strive to be 
            better as well as showing them the social aspect and the life-long friends that one makes while pursuing music
            whether that be as a hobbyist or professional. 
        </p>

        <p>
            During the lock-down period, Conor was invited to create an online beginner's course in the B/C button accordion
            which availabe to anyone on YouTube for FREE. There are 11 easy-to-follow lesson on this course. This can be a great opportunity to start your musical journey on the
            button accordion. See the YouTube video below...
